# Lepus Inc. Code Challenges

This repository houses the code challenges for Lepus.

## Guideline

* We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time, if you need it.
* At first, please fork this repository into your own public repository and start coding.
* Once you have submitted your solution, please send us the url of your public repository. Our engineers will review the code.
* Review process might take us *1 week* to give you feedback on the submission. Based on the feedback, we may invite you for a meeting to talk more about your submission.
